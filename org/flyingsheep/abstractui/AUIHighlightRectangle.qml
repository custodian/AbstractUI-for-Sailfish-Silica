//This rectangle is intended to be used as a highlight, e.g. in a ListView
//It provides the theme highlight colour:
//For Sailifish this is a light bluey shade,
//For Harmattan I have chosen dark orange
//This means that the app programmer does not need to worry about what the theme colour is.
//The color property can be overwritten in the instance
