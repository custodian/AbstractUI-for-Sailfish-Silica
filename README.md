AbstractUI-for-Sailfish-Silica
==============================

The Sailfish Silica "flavour" of AbstractUI: a multi-platform library for abstracting out platform specific qml controls.

This library is intended to support developing apps that run on both Harmattan and Sailfish
(and potentially other targets in the future) from a common code base, by abstracting platform specific QMLs out of our core apps.

It will be available in both Harmattan and Sailfish "flavours".

For more information please see:

The library is very much work-in-progress, so please bear with me:

2013.06.01 Small changes to README.md files

2013.05.30 Menu handling improved, Menu Demos apss added

2013.05.26 Only partially working: still problems with "missing" controls, "missing" properties, and general differences
in UI look and feel between Harmattan and Sailfish (ToolBarLayout et al).
