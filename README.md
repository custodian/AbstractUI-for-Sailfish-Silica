AbstractUI-for-Sailfish-Silica
==============================

The Sailfish Silica "flavour" of AbstractUI: a multi-platform library for abstracting out platform specific qml controls.

This library is intended to support developing apps that run on both Harmattan and Sailfish (and potentially other targets in the future) from a common code base, by abstracting plaform specific QMLs out of our core apps.

It will be available in both Harmattan and Sailfish "flavours".

The library is very much work-in-progress, so please bear with me:

2013.05.26 Only partially working: still problems with "missing" controls, "missing" properties, and general differences
in UI look and feel between Harmattan and Sailfish (ToolBarLayout et al).
